<h2>Layers</h2>
<p>A forest is made up of many layers. Starting from the ground level and moving up, the main layers of all forest types are the forest floor, the understory and the canopy. The emergent layer exists in tropical rainforests. Each layer has a different set of plants and animals depending upon the availability of sunlight, moisture and food.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Forest floor contains</b> decomposing leaves, animal droppings, and dead trees. Decay on the forest floor forms new soil and provides nutrients to the plants. The forest floor supports ferns, grasses, mushroom and tree seedlings.</li>
<li><b>Understory</b> is made up of bushes, shrubs, and young trees that are adapted to living in the shades of the canopy.</li>
<li><b>Canopy</b> is formed by the mass of intertwined branches, twigs and leaves of the mature trees. The crowns of the dominant trees receive most of the sunlight. This is the most productive part of the trees where maximum food is produced. The canopy forms a shady, protective "umbrella" over the rest of the forest.</li>
<li><b>Emergent layer</b> exists in the tropical rain forest and is composed of a few scattered trees that tower over the canopy.</li>
