<h2>Types</h2>
<p>Forests can be classified in different ways and to different degrees of specificity. One such way is in terms of the biome in which they exist, combined with leaf longevity of the dominant species (whether they are evergreen or deciduous). Another distinction is whether the forests are composed predominantly of broadleaf trees, coniferous (needle-leaved) trees, or mixed.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Boreal forests</b> occupy the subarctic zone and are generally evergreen and coniferous.</li>
<li><b>Temperate</b> zones support both broadleaf deciduous forests (e.g., temperate deciduous forest) and evergreen coniferous forests (e.g., temperate coniferous forests and temperate rainforests). Warm temperate zones support broadleaf evergreen forests, including laurel forests.</li>
<li><b>Tropical</b> and subtropical forests include tropical and subtropical moist forests, tropical and subtropical dry forests, and tropical and subtropical coniferous forests.</li>
<li><b>Physiognomy</b> classifies forests based on their overall physical structure or developmental stage (e.g. old growth vs. second growth).</li>
